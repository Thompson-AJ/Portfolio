                        <h3>Writing a legal description with Python</h3>
                        <p>I created a versatile python script that automates the process of generating a proper legal description for an area of land. While this is not normally a complicated task, when you are trying to describe the exact border of a fire district in words it can get a bit lengthy, and trying to do it by hand would take a huge amount of time and resources. This script eliminates about 90 percent of that cost.</p>

                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>This was my first major project while working for PHG. After learning about the emergency response process I noticed that the pre-incident plans that they used for responding to emergencies were very outdated and left a lot to be desired.</p>
                        <p>After having my idea to modernize the reports approved, I spent most of my first term as an intern developing a much more sophisticated system for both the now called "Pre Plans" and the system in which they are created.</p>
                        <p>I combined both my skills as a UAS pilot and GIS student to create a mostly automated system for collection and creation of the Pre Plans</p>
                        <p>Two sets of information are gathered in the field, first being the aerial imagery, these photos are taken to provide a clear view of the structure and are later annotated to show important infrastructure on the building</p>
                        <p>Next I created a fieldmaps tool that allows the acquisition of all relevant data pertaining to the structure, from contact info, to water supply information, to special hazards.</p>
                        <p>Upon completion of this project a large number of structures were collected across the fire district including all educational buildings. These preplans are now in use today by the fire department and are invaluable to their response process.</p>
