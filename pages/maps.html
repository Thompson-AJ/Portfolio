                        <h3>Cartography Reference Map</h3>
                        <p>This project actually started out as a personal challenge. The GE for one of my cartography classes told us that no one should really ever use hot pink in their maps. becuase it "never looks good". I thought I would try and make it work, after trying a few color schemes and finding good reference online i settled on teh colors you see and created this map for that assignment.</p>

                        <h3>LCC First Responder Map</h3>
                        <p>This map was designed as part of the Pre Plan Project. While it does not follow traditional cartographic principles, It is a highly functional map that provides the exact necessary details that first responders need when arriving at this location. It was designed to be extremely high contrast, as simple as possible while combining as much information as is needed, and had to be as to scale as possible. Once challenge was designing a symbology for the roads that didn't require a key, but also allows first responders to know what the accesibilty is in the area.</p>
